To learn more about databases in Auth.js and how they are used, check out [databases in the FAQ](/concepts/faq#databases).

## How to use a database

See the [documentation for adapters](/reference/adapters) for more information on advanced configuration, including how to use Auth.js with other databases using a [custom adapter](/guides/adapters/creating-a-database-adapter).
