- [SvelteKit](https://sveltekit-auth-example.vercel.app/)
- [SolidStart](https://auth-solid.vercel.app/)

Continue to our tutorials to see how to use Auth.js for authentication:

- [Setup with OAuth](/getting-started/oauth-tutorial)
- [Setup with magic links](/getting-started/email-tutorial)
- [Integrating with external auth](/getting-started/credentials-tutorial)

### Battery included

- Built in support for 60+ popular services (Google, Facebook, Auth0, Appleâ€¦)
- Built-in email/password-less/magic link
- Use with any OAuth 2 or OpenID Connect provider
- Use with any username/password store

### Flexible
- Runtime agnostic - run anywhere! Vercel Edge Functions, Node.js, Serverless, etc.
- Use with any modern framework! Next.js, SolidStart, SvelteKit, etc.
- [Bring Your Own Database](/getting-started/databases) - or none! MySQL, Postgres, MSSQL, MongoDB, etc. Choose database sessions or JWT.

_Note: Email sign-in requires a database to store single-use verification tokens._

### Secure by default
- Signed, prefixed, server-only cookies
- Built-in CSRF protection
- Doesn't rely on client-side JavaScript
- JWT with JWS / JWE / JWK.
